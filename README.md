# Draco (An Evil Hacking Software - Chrome Extension)
People do not like good things. So, we creating something devil...

## The story behind the hack...
I (Prakshal) has been working on a social media platform for past 1 year for idea sharing and team formation. It have a lot of potential, and people say it all the time... However, when it comes to grabbing attention, it didn't really had that element.

I got an idea to build an evil google chrome extention, and I ran to my friend's room (Malo). He doesn't really give a damn about any boring projects, however, this one got his attention. He jumped out of his chair and we started brainstorming.

We build a skeleton of the project. And it was GOD Level. We made it such that the extension, once added, will never need to be activated. It will just sit in the corner and doesn't even needs to be updated.
Any change we want to make will be on our "hacker" side.

Then, we started writing utility functions (kinda like library), which had a bunch of pre-written functions that can be injected to the target's browser's page.

## What can it do?
Currently, we have the power to take screenshots of the pages and save it on our systems, read the keystrokes (passwords etc.), and erase all contents of a page and show "You are Hacked" message!

We are continuously working more on the REALLY COOL AND EVIL utility functions ;)

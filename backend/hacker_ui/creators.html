                    <h2>The story behind the hack...</h2>
                    <p>
                        I (Prakshal) has been working on a social media platform for past 1 year for idea sharing and
                        team
                        formation. It have a lot of potential, and people say it all the time... However, when it comes
                        to
                        grabbing attention, it didn't really had that element.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <tt><b>May 22, 2022 (4:00 AM)</b></tt><br />
                        I got an idea to build an evil google chrome extention, and I ran to my friend's room (Malo). He
                        doesn't really give a damn about any boring projects, however, this one got his attention. He
                        jumped
                        out of his chair and we started brainstorming.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <tt><b>May 22, 2022 (5:30 AM)</b></tt><br />
                        We build a skeleton of the project. And it was GOD Level. We made it such that the extension,
                        once
                        added, will never need to be activated. It will just sit in the corner and doesn't even needs to
                        be
                        updated.<br />
                        Any change we want to make will be on our "hacker" side.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then, we started writing utility functions (kinda like library), which had a bunch of
                        pre-written
                        functions that can be injected to the target's browser's page.
                    </p>
